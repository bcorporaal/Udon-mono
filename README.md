**Udon mono** is a personal custom build of the [Iosevka font](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka). It combines elements from JetBrains Mono, Pragmata Pro, IBM Plex and Space Mono. The aim is to create a clean flexible font that used for various applications in my personal projects. The most recent font builds are in the dist folder.

To customize and build your own fonts, see the [Iosevka build instructions](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/main/doc/custom-build.md) and use the private-build-plans from this repository as a starting point.
